    "Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is a model-free off-policy algorithm for learning continous actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines ideas from DPG (Deterministic Policy Gradient) and DQN (Deep Q-Network). It uses Experience Replay and slow-learning target networks from DQN, and it is based on DPG, which can operate over continuous action spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Problem</h1>\n",
    "We are trying to solve the classic Inverted Pendulum control problem. In this setting, we can take only two actions: swing left or swing right.\n",
    "\n",
    "What make this problem challenging for Q-Learning Algorithms is that actions are continuous instead of being discrete. That is, instead of using two discrete actions like -1 or +1, we have to select from infinite actions ranging from -2 to +2."
