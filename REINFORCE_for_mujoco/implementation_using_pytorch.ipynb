    "Implementation a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with Gymnasium’s v0.26+ step() function\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using REINFORCE, one of the earliest policy gradient methods. Unlike going under the burden of learning a value function first and then deriving a policy out of it, REINFORCE optimizes the policy directly. In other words, it is trained to maximize the probability of Monte-Carlo returns. More on that later.\n",

    "Inverted Pendulum is Mujoco’s cartpole but now powered by the Mujoco physics simulator - which allows more complex experiments (such as varying the effects of gravity). This environment involves a cart that can moved linearly, with a pole fixed on it at one end and having another end free. The cart can be pushed left or right, and the goal is to balance the pole on the top of the cart by applying forces on the cart. More information on the environment could be found at https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_pendulum/\n",

    "<h1>Policy Network</h1>\n",
    "We start by building a policy that the agent will learn using REINFORCE. A policy is a mapping from the current environment observation to a probability distribution of the actions to be taken. The policy used in the tutorial is parameterized by a neural network. It consists of 2 linear layers that are shared between both the predicted mean and standard deviation. Further, the single individual linear layers are used to estimate the mean and the standard deviation. nn.Tanh is used as a non-linearity between the hidden layers. The following function estimates a mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution from which an action is sampled. Hence it is expected for the policy to learn appropriate weights to output means and standard deviation based on the current observation."
